# Dymuse

## A customizable entertainment/utility [Discord](https://discord.com) bot with some tweaks.

## DON'T EXPECT GREATNESS

This project is a Discord bot with some unique features, such as:

* A better leveling algorithm that focuses on message length, not just message amount
* Plenty of settings to tune the bot to your liking
* Some other random changes I prefer

[there should be some demo images/GIFs here]

## Adding the bot to your server

## Contributing to the code

### Requirements
* Node.js
* A MongoDB database
* npm

### Steps
1. Install the bot by pressing on `Code` and pressing `Download as ZIP`.
2. Extract the contents from the ZIP in a folder of your choice.
3. Open up the command line (on Windows, search `cmd` in the Search bar) and go to the folder the extracted content is in (e.g. `C:/Users/Gamer/Desktop/DymuseFolder`).
4. In the command line, type in `npm install`. That should install all the needed dependencies.
5. To run the bot, use `npm run dev`. To turn it off, do `Ctrl+C` or close the terminal.
